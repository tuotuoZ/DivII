<p>I have spent one and half years with my Division II so far. It’s necessary for me to recap what I have done and what should be improved in my learning experience.</p>
<p>Before entering my Div II, I have been involved in a lot of theatre productions and wanted to keep pursuing my interest in theatre. I also liked computer science a lot but I only took one human-computer interaction course in my Div I which was mainly about the design concept in building a Graphic User Interface, so I wanted to take more fundamental computer courses, like a computer language course, Java. </p>
<p>I am a Computer science and theater concentration student. In my Division time, I tried to find a balance between them. I am satisfied that I made progress on both of the fields. I will start with my theater program.</p>
<p>During the first semester of my Div II, I took a lot of independent studies with professors. The most interesting one was with Professor Mei Ann, Teo. Before the independent study, she agreed to have me for her production, Dim Sum Warrior, in Shanghai, China. I was so excited to be involved in an industry-level production. However, it was a Kungfu play which requires some martial arts experiences. After some discussion, Mei Ann and I decided to start an independent study called Melding Martial Arts into Theater. The design of this course was very unprecedented: we found a Kung Fu master in Amherst and Mei Ann and I went to his private lessons together to learn some basic Kung Fu movements. Every week, Mei Ann and I had a meeting where I demonstrated what I had learned from some very classic Kung Fu media, eg. movies, TV series and theater plays. In the middle of the semester, I brought lots of questions to the Kung Fu master and asked for how to apply them into a theater play, AKA stage fight. Fortunately, our master had been involved with choreographing for movies. He choreographed a series of fights between Mei Ann and me. In the end, we presented this fighting scene to our whole theater community. I think this was a truly innovative learning experience, from a perspective that I can design the course, use resources outside the campus, and be highly engaged with the professor. At the final presentation, I also learned basic lightning control from our theater program facilitator. Overall, it was a compound class which involved abundant materials. It’s a course which is not only in the classroom but also goes beyond. Most importantly, I learned how to design a class, how to learn on your own, and how to be motivated by a project and work around it.</p>
<p>I really like how Hampshire encourages people to set up the project-based learning experience. Thus, I continued to another independent study with Mei Ann in the next semester. The study was about how to become a director and the setup of the study is quite interesting: I was working as a designer to do preliminary research and drawing. Then I would present my work to Mei Ann, who was the director. We were doing this to simulate the scenarios in which a director would face. When I put myself on a designers’ position, I had a better perspective to see how to communicate from a designer’s view to a director’s. Mei Ann also gave me some suggestions on how to give clear instructions to a designer. It was an enlightening class overall, which showed how unconventional the class can be.</p>
<p>Speaking of my projects, I have also involved in two productions, the first one is A Girl’s Life and the second one is Ten Items or Less, a sitcom. I got a lot of experiences as an actor in both of the production. In A Girl’s Life, I was acting as a French scientist who developed a new abortion medication causing a death of a sixteen-year-old girl. There was some medical terminology which was really hard to remember but other than that, it was a lot of fun. We rehearsed for roughly one and half month then we delivered the show in the middle of October.  In A Girl’s Life, I met one of the other actors whose name is Ford. After the collaboration, he invited me to his Div III project, Ten Items or Less. After I knew the show was a sitcom, I got nervous because I had never acted in front of a camera. Ford, as the director of the show, always supported me and guided me how to relax in front of a camera. My first try with the camera turned out to be really good! We live broadcasted to some audience and got countless laughter from them!</p>
<p>In the first summer of my Div II, I went to Shanghai with Professor Mei Ann Teo for a Chinese musical, Dim Sum Warrior. As a zero-background musical person, I learned how to orchestra with different departments in a production like this. Setting deadlines and meeting them was a huge challenge. As a director assistant, I also helped to translate conversations between the director and actors. Translating from a director to actors was really difficult for me because I had to be really precise about the emotion that the director wanted to deliver. We realized how hard that could be for me to translate back into English and forth in Chinese. Fortunately, my girlfriend joined us later in the project and we split the job: she was in charge of translating the Chinese part to the director and I was in charging of translating from director’s English instructions to Chinese. After we settled this workflow, I was less stressed out. Another thing causing difficulties was that we were changing the script frequently. Actors were having a hard time to understand the plot for the whole story. Things were getting better when we settle the final script. It became an interesting process to see how everyone knew other’s opinions better even though there was a language barrier. We had a successful premiere at the beginning of August. I think I have a better understanding of how to work on a multi-language team production and how should prevent miscommunication at the beginning. </p>
<p>I was not satisfied by only learning this much in theater, and I started to build-up myself in computer science. I was hesitant about choosing my first computer language and spent quite a lot of time on picking the right class. I asked my Committee Chair:” Which language is the best language to start with?” My chair, Professor Jaime Davila, told me that: ”It doesn’t matter which one you pick right now. There is something way beyond the language in computer science. After you learn that, you will find out you can pick up any language quickly.” At that time, it would take me a lot to learn one language, I couldn’t imagine how I was going to learn a language quickly. After all, I started my first programming class at Mount Holyoke College. The class was about Object Oriented Programming. I had got some experience with Python before and that did help me in this class. I was more into the concept of Objects. We were using Java to learn. I started to build applications with multi-classes. Building Graphic User Interface was really satisfying for me because I could demonstrate my work to my friends and parents.</p>
<p>After the OOP(Object Oriented Programming) class, I took one of the most important classes to my computer science learning, which is Data Structure. When I was in the OOP class, I asked a problem of how to create a really large list of different information to the lab instructor. He told me that it was too early for me to understand the problem and he told me Data Structure was the class to go to. Indeed, Data Structure taught me how to think in a higher level and how to take care of the data. In the past, I was only considering how to manipulate the element on the screen. For example, how to create the button, where should I put it, and how to make the square move on a screen. Nevertheless, programming’s core is about dealing with different data, the data that users send in, the data that users trying to get out and which data structure I should use based on users’ need. The class also covered some basic algorithms like searching and sorting. I applied those data into Java applet. As I was programming bigger apps than I was doing in the OOP class, debugging became a major problem. It’s getting harder and harder for me to identify the problem in the code. Fortunately, I got lots of help from the TAs and formed a good debugging habit, such as debugging a little by a little instead of finishing the whole program then debug, comment enough information in different functions, and etc.</p>
<p>In the last semester of my Div II, I happened to take a Data Science course. It was programming related but pushed me to a new world, Data Science. I benefited a lot from this course. As an introduction to Data Science, the class covers some Data Visualization, basic, and machine learning. We learned some practical skills pretty quickly so that in the middle of the semester I could go to a competition called DataFest and actually won a prize from it! Our group’s presentation was to criticize how linear the star-rating system was, and we also gave an advice on how to give a multi-dimension description for a company on a job searching website. It was thrilling to get some positive feedback at the beginning of the class. It’s a course that not only teaches you skills but also points to the further direction for your learning. My Div III will focus on machine learning.</p>
<p>In my second summer, I had a precious opportunity to work with Professor Ethan Meyers at MIT. We were developing a Neural Decoding Toolbox in a computer language called R. It was my first time to work on a real-life project. I faced some difficulties in being familiar with the tools to work in a team, to develop code, and to writing documentation. Luckily, I got lots of help from my peers and Professor Ethan Meyers. We ended up finishing the documentation and I finished a side project to speed up the computation time in a cloud server. Overall, it was a delightful experience to work there and I found out lots of aspects that I should improve as a programmer. For example, I should keep close attention to some latest developing tools so that I can apply what I have learned to applications which are integrated with new technology and framework.</p>
<p>Looking back my Div II, I am happy with what I achieved in both Theater and Computer Science department. I had been involved with many projects in acting and got abundant coding practices. Especially, I remember that I was pretty anxious about which programming language I should start with, and the reply from Professor Jaime Davila saying:” There is something way beyond language in Computer Science.” Now, I can code in Java, Python, Clojure, and R and I am also learning Swift recently. I didn’t think I can put 4 languages in my inventory at the end of my Div II which really surprised me. It’s fulfilling to see I can understand the core knowledge behind the language in Computer Science so that I can pick up a new language quickly. Now, I know the language is only about the computer syntax and the design of the program, the algorithm you implement, data structure, etc are more about the computer science. </p>
<p>There are also some skills that I should improve in my coming Div III. My writing skill is quite underdeveloped still. I wasn’t paying attention at the beginning of my college life because I was thinking that as a programmer I would only talk in code, writing is for a more literal job. I was holding that premature opinion until Professor Lee Spector illustrated how important the skill is to a programmer, essentially everyone because writing is also part of communication. How can you be a terrible writer and a good communicator at the same time? I will expose myself in writing more in my Div III and I will ask for more help from the professor. Speak of getting help from Professors, I should definitely reach them more actively. I had a lot of time when I was stuck on a project and didn’t get help from Professor. And that really dropped my speed in finishing my project. I found that meeting with Professor doesn’t have to be a review process for your project, it can be fundamentally constructive so even when I am hesitating of how should I start with my project, I should go get help. </p>
<p>In my Div III, I will be focusing on machine learning. I got inspired by my Artificial Intelligence with Professor Lee Spector. Lee always told us to think in a higher view because we were learning a new language called Clojure which had a seemingly complex syntax for creating a loop to manipulate data in a set one by one but an easy way to build function to manipulate data in a set at the same time if you can find the outside pattern of this set. It was also related to the theme of the class, I should teach the computer some pattern so they can learn. I want to make the computer learn instead of to make the computer do. I want to build a machine learning model to build a better image classifier. Hopefully, I can improve such that and have a content Div III.</p>
